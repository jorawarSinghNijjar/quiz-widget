    "NMN": {
    name: "NMN",
    impact: "Energy levels, longevity",
    dosage: "500mg per day if under 35, 1000mg per day if over 35. ",
    howToTake:
      "Take in the morning right after waking up as it can cause sleeplessness if taken too close to bedtime. ",
    moreDetails:
      "NAD, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is fuel for our mitochondria, which are responsible for energy production in the body. As we age, we produce less and less NAD, which is why our energy levels decrease. By supplementing NMN, the precursor to NAD, we can boost energy levels immediately and improve physical performance in the short term. In the long term, NAD is thought to have a powerful anti-aging effect, since it is key to allowing Sirtuins to function. Sirtuins unlock our ancient survival pathways and promote long lifespan",

  "Resveratrol": {
    name: "Resveratrol",
    impact: "Weight control, metabolic health, longevity",
    dosage: "500mg each day",
    howToTake:
      "Take in the morning or with your first meal. Needs to be taken with a source of fat e.g. mixed in with morning yoghurt, peanut butter or olive oil. Resveratrol is hydrophobic and cannot be absorbed by the body unless dissolved in fat first",
    moreDetails:
      "Resveratrol is a powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory found in red wine, berries and other sources. It has similar effects on your body as a calorie restricted diet, which means it can produce the same life-lengthening benefits of calorie restriction. It protects the brain from cognitive decline, improves insulin resistance, and the anti-inflammatory properties have been linked to improvements in arthritis and skin inflammation",

  "TMG": {
    name: "TMG",
    impact: "provide source of methyl groups",
    dosage: "500mg up to 1000mg per day",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "If you are taking NMN or NR for longer than a few months, it is important to also take TMG or another source of Methyl groups. As NMN is metabolised, it uses up Methyl groups from the body in the process, which need to be replaced.",

  "Vit D Mg K2": {
    name: "Vitamin D3, K2 and Mg",
    impact: "Stronger bones, mental health, musculoskeletal health",
    dosage:
      "5000 IU Vitamin D3, 120mcg Vitamin K2 (Mk-7) and 250mg Magnesium (L-Threonate)",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "These three key vitamins and minerals work best when taken together. Vitamin D deficiency is common among developed nations and many of us take a Vitamin D supplement, but without magnesium this Vitamin D cannot be used properly. Magnesium intake is low in populations who consume modern, processed-food diets which can result in muscle spasms, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, irregular heartbeats, and headaches. Vitamin K2 also plays an active role in the metabolism of calcium, so your vitamin D won't be able to translate to healthier bones without K2 and Mg.",

  "Omega 3": {
    name: "Omega 3",
    impact: "Boosts mood, joint health, brain health",
    dosage:
      "1.5-2g with 1g EPA for brain and joint benefits, 2-4g for mental health benefits.",
    howToTake:
      "In the morning with water Omega 3 should be kept in the fridge to prevent oxidation.",
    moreDetails:
      "Omega 3 is a polyunsaturated fat which can be found in plant or animal sources. It is linked to better mood (equal to antidepressants in some clinical trials) as well as lower inflammation, better joint health, and longer lifespan. Omega 3 tablets are typically made up of APA and EPA, and the best quality supplements have high amounts of EPA. You should try to get 1500g of EPA per day, which usually means 2 good quality fish oil tablets. We recommend keeping omega 3 in the fridge as this prevents oxidation which could reduce functionality",

  "Fisetin": {
    name: "Fisetin",
    impact: "Longevity, improved immunity, mental health",
    dosage: "400mg",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "Fisetin is a natural antioxidant with powerful anti-aging effects. It is found in strawberries, apples and persimmon and has incredible antiaging potential. It is a powerful senolytic, meaning it reduces the number of senescent cells in the body which are the cells that increase as you age and damage surrounding tissue. Outside of the antiaging space, Fisetin has also shown potential to fight multiple cancers, protect the brain from strokes, reduce inflammation, reduce seizures, support the immune system and fight many other diseases.",
  },

  "Quercetin": {
    name: "Quercetin",
    impact: "Longevity, weight control, allergy/inflammation",
    dosage: "400mg",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "Quercetin increases the half-life of resveratrol and reduces the hallmarks of aging, as well as reducing inflammation, shrinking fat cells, lowering blood pressure, body weight and the risk of heart disease. It has been previously used for allergy sufferers and reduces many symptoms associated with arthritis. Is also protective against dementia and diabetes. Important to note however that it interacts with quite a few prescription medications so not one to take if you are elderly and likely to need medical intervention.",

  "Berberine": {
    name: "Berberine",
    impact: "Metabolic health, cholesterol, longevity",
    dosage: "500mg per dose ",
    howToTake: "2-3 times a day before main meals",
    moreDetails: `If getting a prescription for metformin is not an option for you, then Berberine can be the next best thing. It has been shown to be as effective as metformin at controlling your blood sugars and decreases insulin resistance. Berberine plays a key role in metabolism, lowering your LDL or "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides and is cardioprotective. It has also been shown in some studies to activate sirtuins, those key longevity enzymes in your survival circuit.

    impact: "Looking younger, joint health, improved immunity",
    dosage: "200mg/day",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "If you are concerned about the physical consequences of aging then hyaluronic acid may be for you. Skin aging is associated with a loss of skin moisture, and the key molecule involved in skin moisture is hyaluronic acid, as it has a unique capacity to bind and retain water molecules. Other than creating youthful skin, hyaluronic acid also improves lubrication of joints and can help regulate the immune system. Many studies have indicated that Hyaluronic acid may protect against respiratory diseases, assist with wound healing, alleviate dry eyes, protect bone density and reduce painful joints when taken orally",

  "CA-AKG": {
    name: "CA-AKG",
    impact: "Looking younger, lifespan extension, energy levels",
    dosage: "800mg/day (two capsules)",
    howToTake: "In the morning with water",
    moreDetails:
      "Calcium Alpha Ketoglutarate is vital for production of energy but unfortunately our natural supplies decrease as we age. In some studies it has shown promise inhibiting MTOR and activating AMPK, two of the key pathways associated with longevity. It has been associated with reversing grey hair and extending healthspan by 41%! It is important for healthy bones, collagen production and protecting stem cells",
